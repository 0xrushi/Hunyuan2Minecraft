# ðŸ—¼ Hunyuan2Minecraft: Build Beautiful Structures in Minecraft Using Images + AI

Turn stunning real-world or AI-generated images into Minecraft builds â€” powered by [Hunyuan 2.1](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1/) and voxel conversion pipelines.

## ðŸ’¡ Why?

Minecraft agents are getting better at chopping trees and mining but when it comes to building **realistic**, **beautiful**, and **creative** structures, they fail.

Inspired by projects like [Claude building the Eiffel Tower (poorly ðŸ˜¬)](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1jgicku/claudes_building_the_eiffel_tower_in_realtime/), this project bridges the gap between **vision models** and **blocky reality**.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Image Input**  
   Provide a real-world or AI-generated image of a structure.

2. **Hunyuan 2.1 Vision Model**  
   We extract structural and spatial data using Hunyuan.

3. **Voxelization**  
   Convert image â†’ 3D voxel matrix (supports STL/OBJ pipelines or direct voxel inference).

4. **Minecraft Block Mapping**  
   Map voxel materials to Minecraft blocks intelligently.

## ToDO 

[ ] Implement cluster detection unsupervised algorithm to automatically detect colors for generated textures

[ ] Develop an algorithm to convert the color hues to minecraft blocks like orange = pumpkin block
